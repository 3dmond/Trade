# Trade
Trade stocks with predetermined prices and hope to land the greatest margin/profit.
The project isn't an actual trading app/console rather more of a game. 
Initial thought is for users to select various stocks from different countries, hold and sell after a period they decide.
Price increases and decreases to be calculated via implemented formulas.
Stocks that will increase in price and those that will reduce are predetermined...however final prices are via calculations.
Balances, transaction fees, taxes and other costs that are usually incurred to also be factored in.
User to select the currency they want to trade in, and prices and transactions to be viewed by selected currency.
Currency can only be of one of the seven listed countries (or any listed should there be additions and/or deletions).
